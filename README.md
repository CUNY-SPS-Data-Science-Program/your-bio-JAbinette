I am Jennifer Abinette though I usually go by Jen.  I have a husband (Ed) and 2 black cats (Lincoln & Salem) and just spent three weeks this summer traveling in Italy, Croatia and Ireland.  My grandfather was born and raised in a small town in Croatia and my brother and I hope to eventually own a house there since it is beautiful!  The best way to contact me is through my email account jennifer.abinette@protonmail.com.

I have bachelor degrees in Mathematics and Psychology and an associates in applied science for Business Administration - Accounting.  I currently work for New York State in Albany as an auditor of State payments supervising advanced data analytics teams.  In the past few years, we have increasingly used a relational database to automate risk assessments and reports helping auditors to identify risky State payments.  Pursuing a master's degree in data science is the next step in furthering my career as I would like to transfer to a more technical Data Analyst role. 

I am most comfortable and competent in SQL and R, but I do have some experience in Python, Batch Script and Windows CMD.  I do not have experience with Java Script or Geographic Information Systems.  I look forward to this class enabling me to improve the Data Visualizations that we have created at work!
